        link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.27496
           We supplemented antibody-producing Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells with 2FP, galactose, and uridine and saw targeted effects on antibody glycosylation (e.g. galactosylation and fucosylation) without sacrificing culture growth or antibody yield.
